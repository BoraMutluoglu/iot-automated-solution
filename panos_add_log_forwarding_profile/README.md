# Add Cortex Data Lake ready Log Forwarding Profile

Configure a new log forwarding profile that is ready-to-go for CDL
and Enhanced Application Logging.

This profile is only configured for CDL and if syslog or other forwarding
capabilities required, those must be added manually based on the user scenario.

The only input is the name to be used for the log forwarding profile.
