# Enable Device Identification per Zone

To use Device-ID to detect devices and enforce your security policy, you must enable
Device-ID in the internal, source zone of your IoT traffic. As a best practice, you 
should enable Device-ID in the source zone of your IoT clients and should not 
enable it for Internet/external zones.

This skillet allows the user to select one or more virtual zones for the configuration
update.
