# Add DHCP Security Policy

Create a new security policy based on the `dhcp` application for visbility purposes
and to ensure it has a log forwarding profile that is configured for Cortex Data Lake and
Enhanced Application Logging.

Once the rule is added the user can decide where to place the rule:

* top or bottom
* before or after with a reference rule name
